    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The word kibbeh stems from an Arabic verb meaning, "to form into a ball;" so that description is not entirely
        wrong. But as you'll see in today's kibbeh recipe, they're more like stuffed croquettes. There is a crispy outer
        shell made with bulgur wheat, onions, and finely ground beef. The shell is then stuffed with a mixture of spiced
        beef and toasted pine nuts; sealed and then fried or baked.
