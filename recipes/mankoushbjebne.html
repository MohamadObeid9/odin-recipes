    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cheese manakish is a delicious Lebanese flatbread made with a mixture of shredded cheese on homemade dough. It's
        kind of like a Middle Eastern pizza but better. After all, what's better than gooey, melted cheese wrapped up in
        warm flatbread dough?</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Akkawi cheese: This is a kind of salty cheese often sold at Lebanese stores anywhere in the world. Make sure
            to shred this cheese if you are going to use it in this recipe. A good substitute for akawi is mozzarella
            (or any other cheese that melts well)</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese: I mix a little mozzarella cheese with akawi cheese and it makes for a delicious cheese
            mixture.</li>
        <li>Teta's Homemade Dough Recipe: My favorite recipe for Lebanese dishes. Its ingredients are as follows: active
            dry yeast, vegetable oil, milk, salt, sugar, flour, egg, and water. If you are short on time, you can use
            ready-made pizza dough, whole wheat biscuit dough, and dinner roll dough.</li>
        <li>Dried herbs: Mint, oregano, basil, or thyme. These are optional but add a ton of flavor. I usually sprinkle
            them on top of the pastries once they're out of the oven.</li>
        <li>Vegetables: Cucumbers, mint leaves, tomatoes, peppers. In Lebanon when you add veggies to any manousheh it
            turns it into a "manousheh extra," so even though these are also optional, they are highly recommended.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the dough (or use store-bought dough). To make homemade dough, place the dry ingredients (flour,
            active dry yeast, salt, and sugar) in a large mixing bowl. Create a well in the middle. Crack the egg and
            pour all the liquid ingredients (lukewarm water, milk, and vegetable oil) into the well. Scrape the sides
            into the liquid ingredients and combine everything together. Then start kneading the dough. Remove the dough
            from the bowl and place it on a floured countertop. Continue kneading by hand for up to 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and a kitchen towel. Let the dough rise for an hour while preparing the
            cheese and chopped vegetables. </li>
        <li>Shred the cheeses into a bowl. Heat the oven to 350 ℉ (180 ℃). After the dough has rested, knead for five
            more minutes. Then, split the manakish dough into even balls (about 10). Roll out the dough ball into
            similar-sized circles on a floured surface using a rolling pin. </li>
        <li>Place the manakish dough (without the cheese) on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in an
            oven at 350 ℉ (180 ℃) for around 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and top each dough circle with a heaped
            tablespoon of the cheese mix. Pop back into the oven for around 5-7 minutes, or until the cheese is
            completely melted. Cut the manouche into equal pieces (like a pizza) or fold it in half. </li>
    </ol>
