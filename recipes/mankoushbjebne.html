    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cheese manakish is a delicious Lebanese flatbread made with a mixture of shredded cheese on homemade dough. It's
        kind of like a Middle Eastern pizza but better. After all, what's better than gooey, melted cheese wrapped up in
        warm flatbread dough?</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Akkawi cheese: This is a kind of salty cheese often sold at Lebanese stores anywhere in the world. Make sure
            to shred this cheese if you are going to use it in this recipe. A good substitute for akawi is mozzarella
            (or any other cheese that melts well)</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese: I mix a little mozzarella cheese with akawi cheese and it makes for a delicious cheese
            mixture.</li>
        <li>Teta's Homemade Dough Recipe: My favorite recipe for Lebanese dishes. Its ingredients are as follows: active
            dry yeast, vegetable oil, milk, salt, sugar, flour, egg, and water. If you are short on time, you can use
            ready-made pizza dough, whole wheat biscuit dough, and dinner roll dough.</li>
        <li>Dried herbs: Mint, oregano, basil, or thyme. These are optional but add a ton of flavor. I usually sprinkle
            them on top of the pastries once they're out of the oven.</li>
        <li>Vegetables: Cucumbers, mint leaves, tomatoes, peppers. In Lebanon when you add veggies to any manousheh it
            turns it into a "manousheh extra," so even though these are also optional, they are highly recommended.</li>
    </ul>
